## Edit content

To edit the content of the pages, go to the content folder and edit the markdown files.

There are one markdown file per page except for the home page: `home-hero.md` is for top main part of the main page,
and `home.md` is for the rest of the page.

## Images

To add images with captions under it, add "caption: " at the beginning of the alternative text.
For example:

```markdown
![caption: This is a cat](https://loremflickr.com/320/240/cat)
```
